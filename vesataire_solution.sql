-- 4: When and why should you create a table or a view?
   
  /* Tables -->
   * Why Tables?:  Can be directly updated, hence they're faster for basic operations eg: add, update, or delete. They support ACID properties
   * (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) which means they support reliable transactions.
   * 
   * 
   * When Tables? : When we want to store actual data. Also when there are frequent modifications then we use tables.
   * They're also used when we want to impose data integrity eg: defining relationships, foreign, primary keys or unique constraints 
   * between different fields, other tables. Useful for data modeling purposes. Used when we have to query large amounts of data, for performance, can
   * use indexes

   * 
   * 
   * 
   * Views --> 
   * They don't store data themselves, but act as a predefined query that fetchess and organizes data.
   * 
   * Why Views? : Efficient in terms of data storage, doesn't store data, just a virtual representation. 
   * In this case,we can save sending the many bytes again and again. Moreover, when we want to enforce data consistency
   * 
   * 
   * When Views?: When we want to handle complex joins easily, alongside aggregations, or calculations into a single view.
   * Helps to add/remove field without changing the schema. Plus, the GRANT commands
   * which controls data access better. Also, its more use-case specific, eg: when we want to have filtered, calcultaed, and formatted data. Overall 
   * giving a focussed result-set for the users. Furthermore, they support reusability, the same complex queries across multiple places in application 
   *

-- 10: Problems with Query; debugging


/*Improvements for the Provided Query:
1. Simplification in subquery :
The subquery for CATEGORY can be joined to DWH_PRD.DIM_VC_PRD_PRODUCT table directly instead of using a subquery.
Moreover,  can remove redundant GROUP BY 1, 2 from the sellers CTE as DISTINCT already ensures uniqueness.
2. Consistency in alias :
Thereâ€™re no consistent aliases for tables throughout the query. For example, use o instead of O for DWH_SLS.FCT_VC_SLS_ORDER_PRODUCT. 
Can be made better by  having a lowercase and descriptive approach. Also, for the CTE name sellers could have been use , instead of us sellers to improve clarity.
3. Uselesss "where" clause:
The WHERE Us.ID_SELLER_COUNTRY = 223 clause is already applied in the first WITH clause. We can remove from the second WHERE clause.
4. "Join" optimization:
Can use an inner join instead of a left join on us_sellers and DWH_SLS.FCT_VC_SLS_ORDER_PRODUCT tables if we only want data where a 
seller exists and has placed an order.
5. Window functions:
Can create a window function to calculate CURRENT_DATE once per query execution.
6. Cleaning of code:
There is no fixed spacing around commas, parentheses, and operators for consistency. (especially in the select clauses) 
7. Column naming selection:
Must only select necessary columns to optimize performance, especially in column-store databases as hinted.
Moreover, if we filter at early steps that will reduce the dataset size before joins and aggregations. eg: I think date filter should have been up in CTE
